# ARoGS
This is the implementation of Action Rules extraction algorithm - ARoGS &amp; then to compute the support and confidence of the action rules.
I created Graphical User Interface which shows what my program is doing at all times , and displays the Final List of Action rules , along with their Support and Confidence.

 # DATASETS
I have used the Mammographic Mass Dataset and the Car Evaluation Dataset from [here](http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLSummary.html).


 # DEMO
I have uploaded my project demo in a file in this git. Make sure to download the file in this [link](https://github.com/RahulReddy-Arva/ARoGS/blob/master/PPT%20and%20recordings/recording.webm) to watch the demo.

# WHY DO THIS?
    1. To find out which actions need to be taken to see the desired outcome
    2. Reclassification of tumors
    3. Improve services provided
    4. Understand clients/customers
