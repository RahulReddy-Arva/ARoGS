# ARoGS
This is the implementation of Action Rules extraction algorithm - ARoGS &amp; then to compute the support and confidence of the action rules.

I have used the Mammographic Mass Dataset and the Car Evaluation Dataset from [here](http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLSummary.html)
I created Graphical User Interface which shows what my program is doing at all times , and displays the Final List of Action rules , along with their Support and Confidence.
